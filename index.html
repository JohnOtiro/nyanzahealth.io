<h2>Ovc Support In Kenya</h2>
<p>Kenya now has a growing number, of OVC. An estimated 2.6 million Kenyan children are orphans, who are under 18 years and have lost one or both parents as a result of death. Nearly two thirds of the orphans in Kenya have lost their parents due to HIV/AIDS. Also, the proportion is increasing, as it was approximately 44 percent of all children in Kenya in 2007 (Kenya Demographic Health Survey-KDHS 2003), compared to about 11 percent just five years earlier (Kenya Demographic Health Survey-KDHS 2002). In addition to orphans, there are increasing numbers of other "vulnerable children", who are also especially in need. The National AIDS Control </p>

<h2>Adult Care And Support</h2>
<p>Palliative care is critical for quality of life of adults living with HIV/AIDS. It includes prevention of pain symptoms and suffering from the onset of HIV diagnosis and involves clinical, psychological, spiritual, social and prevention care. To achieve this, NYAHEN  undertakes the following:<br>
1.	Prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections. <br>
2.	Routine follow-up to determine optimum time for ART eligibility.<br>
3.	Support for adherence to ART.<br>
4.	Interventions that address the non-physical suffering of HIV positive individual and family members.<br>
5.	Nutritional support.<br>
6.	Community mobilization and leadership development for community and clinic-based support groups.<br>
7.	Referral linkages between community and clinic based services.<br>
8.	TB screening.<br>
9.	Referral for TB treatment.<br>
10.	Prevention with positives interventions.

    <div class="con-work">
<h2>Community Health Program</h2>
<p>NYAHEN  health programs are implemented within the context of HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS is global pandemic that has permeated societies and distorted the social fabrics thereby impeding social and economic development. The pandemic continues to pose tremendous challenges to the healthcare system in Kenya. HIV/AIDS spread in Kenya peaked in the 1990s, with prevalence rates of as high as 20-30% recorded in certain areas of the country especially Nyanza province where NYAHEN ' activities are concentrated. Concerted efforts by the government and non-state actors dwarfed the trend to reach current level of 5.9%. </p>

    <div class="con-work">
<h2>Adult TreatMent</h2>
<p>The focus of this strategy is on the provision of ARV drugs to HIV positive adults in clinical settings operated by NYAHEN . Services are provided as per national guidelines (Ministry of Helth guidelines-Kenya). NYAHEN  has adequate capacity to undertake patient education, psychosocial support, prevention with positives, clinical staging, prophylaxis (INH, cotrimoxazole, fluconazole), preparation for ARV treatment, clinical monitoring, response to side effects, adherence preparation and support, management of chronic problems, TB screening, referral for TB treatment and data collection based on national reporting tools for clients. </p>
</div>
    
    <div class="con-work">
<h2>Peadtric Care And Support</h2>
<p>While pediatric palliative care mirrors adult palliative care in many ways, issues related to the delivery of HIV palliative care for pediatric clients are different. The clinical course of HIV is more rapid in children, and mortality for infected babies is as high as 40 percent in the first year of life. Maternal antibodies make serologic diagnosis of HIV difficult in the first 18 months. 
Unless virology diagnostic tools are available, this means that interventions such as cotrimoxazole prophylaxis and safe infant feeding must be initiated before diagnosis is confirmed. Children are dependent on adults for their care. These adults are identified, recruited, and educated as to how to care for the child.</p>

   <div class="con-work">
<h2>TB/HIV</h2>
<p>The focus of this activity area is to expand availability of quality TB/HIV care and treatment services to the community through a comprehensive collaborative framework with other service providers both at community and health care settings. The activities implemented under this program area aim to: <br> 
1.	PMTCT activities focus on all the four prongs: Primary prevention of HIV in HIV negative women; prevention of unwanted pregnancy in HIV positive women; interruption Increase demand for TB and TB/HIV diagnosis and treatment services.<br>
2.	Strengthen the capacity of health care providers in delivering TB/HIV gas station.<br>
3.	Strengthen capacity for laboratory diagnosis of TB.<br>
4.	Strengthen HIV screening among TB patients and/or suspects in TB settings.<br>
5.Strengthen TB screening for HIV positive individuals in all care and treatment settings of mother-to-child transmission in HIV-positive pregnant women and; support, care and treatment of HIV positive women and their families.        <br><br><br><br>
